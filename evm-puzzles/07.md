The first 4 lines basically copy the entire calldata into memory. The next 4 lines create a contract, the initialization code is taken from the memory at the position that calldata was just loaded.

Afterwards, the next 3 lines check if the `EXTCODESIZE` is equal 1 byte. The contract that we are checking the code size is the one we just created above with `CREATE`, as `CREATE` pushes the address to the stack.

`EXTCODESIZE` is the size of the runtime code of a contract, not the initialization code! The puzzle expects this to be 1 byte (lines `0C` and `0E`). So we just have to write our own initialization code to do all this.

The instruction for this is `CODECOPY`, which works similar to `CALLDATACOPY`. The initialization code will be as follows:

```js
PUSH1 0x01 // 1 byte
PUSH1 ;;;; // position in bytecode, we dont know yet
PUSH1 0x00 // write to memory position 0
CODECOPY   // copies the bytecode 
PUSH1 0x01 // 1 byte
PUSH1 0x00 // read from memory position 0
RETURN     // returns the code copied above
```

In terms of bytecode, this results in `0x60 01 60 ;; 60 00 39 60 01 60 00 F3`. This is a total of 12 bytes, so the `;;;;` position will be 12, which is `0x0C`. The final bytecodes are: `0x6001600C60003960016000F3`.

This code copies 1 byte code into memory, and returns it to EVM so that contract creation is completed. The actual runtime code is arbitrary, it just has to be 1 byte. Furthermore, runtime code comes after the initialization code (starting at 12th position in this case), so we just have to append one byte to the end of the bytecodes above. Let's add `0xEE` for no reason: 0x6001600C60003960016000F3EE`.

That should do it!
