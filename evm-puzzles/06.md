00      0x6000      PUSH1 0x00
02      0x35        CALLDATALOAD
03      0x56        JUMP
04      0xFD        REVERT
05      0xFD        REVERT
06      0xFD        REVERT
07      0xFD        REVERT
08      0xFD        REVERT
09      0xFD        REVERT

11      0x00        STOP
```

`CALLDATALOAD` loads a 32-byte value at the specified byte offset. If 32-bytes go beyond the length of calldata, the overflowing bytes are set to 0. See more on this instruction at <https://www.evm.codes/#35>.

The offset to be loaded is given by the top value in the stack, which is given by `PUSH1 0x00` above. Basically, the calldata itself should have the destination address for `JUMP`. Our `JUMPDEST` is at `0x0A`, so that is our calldata!

But wait, remember that overflowing bytes are set to 0. So if we just send `0x0A`, the remaining 31 bytes will be `00` and we will have `0x0A00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` which is a huge number!

Instead, we must do zero-padding to the left, and send `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000A` as our calldata. This way, reading 32-bytes from the zero offset will yield `0x0A`.
