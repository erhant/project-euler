# Puzzle 3

```js
00      0x36      CALLDATASIZE
01      0x56      JUMP
02      0xFD      REVERT
03      0xFD      REVERT
04      0x5B      JUMPDEST
05      0x00      STOP
```

There is a `JUMPDEST` at 4, so `CALLVALUE` should be 4 bytes. A very simple arbitrary `CALLDATA` would suffice: `0x11223344`.
