The first `CODESIZE` is the size of this puzzle itself, which is `1B` (28 bytes). Next it swaps the `CALLVALUE` with it, and runs `GT`. In effect, this checks if `CODESIZE > CALLVALUE`.

After the successfull `JUMPI`, we are doing a `CALLDATASIZE MOD 0x003 == 0` operation. We want this to be true for the next `JUMPI` to work, so our calldata size must be a multiple of 3.

The destination of `JUMPI` is defined by `CALLVALUE ADD 0x0A`, which should add up to `0x19`. In decimals, `0x0A` is 10 and `0x19` is 25, so our `CALLVALUE` should be 15.
