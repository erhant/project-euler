```

Here we have a `JUMPI` which is a conditional jump. `PUSH1 0x0C` above it provides the correct destination address, so all we have to care about is that the condition value be non-zero. See more on this instruction at <https://www.evm.codes/#57>.

Looking at the lines above in order:

1. `CALLVALUE` pushes the value to the stack.
2. `DUP1` duplicates it, so there are two of the same value in the stack.
3. `MUL` multiplies these two, so we basically squared the call value.
4. `PUSH2 0x0100` pushes `0x0100` to the stack, which is `16 ^ 2` in decimals.
5. `EQ` compares the top two items in the stack, which is `16 ^ 2` and the square of our callvalue! Therefore, giving a callvalue of 16 is the winning move.
