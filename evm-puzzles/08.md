Similar to the previous puzzle, the first 4 lines copy the entire calldata into memory. The next 4 lines create a contract, the initialization code is taken from the memory at the position that calldata was just loaded.

Afterwards, 5 of `0x00` are pushed to the stack. `SWAP5` will exchange the 1st and 6th stack items, and the 6th item at that point is the address yielded from `CREATE`. Next, the remaining gas amount is pushed to stack with `GAS`. All of this was done for the sake of `CALL` instruction:

```js
CALL 
  gas       // given by GAS the previous line
  address   // is the address from CREATE
  value     // 0
  argOffset // 0
  argSize   // 0
  retOffset // 0
  retSize   // 0
```

After `CALL`, a boolean result is pushed to the stack indicating its success. Looking at the following lines we see that this is expected to be 0 (`PUSH1 00` and `EQ` with `JUMPI` afterwards). So we can create a contract with a `REVERT` instruction.

```c
PUSH1 0x00
PUSH1 0x00
REVERT
```

This shall be our runtime code, which in bytecode is `0x60006000FD` at 5 bytes total. We will write the initialization code ourselves too, similar to what we did in the previous puzzle.

```c
PUSH1 0x05 // 5 bytes
PUSH1 0x0C // position of runtime code in bytecode
PUSH1 0x00 // write to memory position 0
CODECOPY   // copies the bytecode 
PUSH1 0x05 // 5 bytes
PUSH1 0x00 // read from memory position 0
RETURN     // returns the code copied above
```

Again the position is `0x0C` because the initialization code is 12 bytes. So our initialization bytecodes are `0x6005600C60003960056000F3` and the runtime bytecodes are `0x60006000FD`. The calldata will be these concatenated: `0x6005600C60003960056000F360006000FD`.
